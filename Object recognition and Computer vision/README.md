## Project on Image captioning

### Title
Image captioning with region attention and fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning

### Abstract of the paper
In the computer vision field, deep neural networks were first mostly used for classification tasks. Now they are rapidly expanding to more challenging applications, in particular in computer vision. We will describe a system focusing on image caption generation: it seeks to automatically describe pictures in human terms. In this paper we report on experimental results with some approaches of these systems, applying it to the Flickr30k dataset.
