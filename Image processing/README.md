## Project of style transfer based on CNN
(FRENCH)

### Abstract

Style transfer is a recent development in deep neural network imaging applications. The limiting factor in previous approaches was the impossibility to explicitly separate the content and style of an image. With the help of convolutional neural networks optimized for object recognition, it is finally possible to distinguish the high level information in an image, i.e. the content, from the low level information of the image, i.e. the style. This paper introduces the first implementation of neural style transfer, by Leon Gatys et al. in 2015 [1]. Their algorithm allows to generate new images combining the content of one image, and the style of another, by example a photo and a painting.
