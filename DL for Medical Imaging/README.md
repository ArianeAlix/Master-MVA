## Title
Vessel Extraction from Retinal Images

## Abstract
In this work, we present a description and evaluation of our
method for the segmentation of blood vessel of retinas. Retinal vessel
segmentation can be of great interest for the diagnosis of retinal vascular
diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic
retinopathy. Therefore, in recent years, several automatic segmentation
methods have been proposed, ranging from the use of simple filters to
Deep Neural Networks.
The methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks mainly rely on
the learning of local patterns of vessels, but do not consider the graphical
structure of those. We think that taking advantage of the vessels network-
like form, inherent to their biological utility, would help improve the vessel
segmentation accuracy. Therefore, our method uses both a IterNet [16]
architecture, intertwined with a Graph Neural Network with Attention to
simultaneously comprehend local, global and structural vessel patterns.
The idea of a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network and a
Graph Network comes from Shin's "VGN" [14], a method developed in
2018 that was the state-of-the-art on retinal vessels segmentation when it
got out.
We evaluated our model on a retinal image called DRIVE, and compared
it to the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average precision,
AUC and F-measure. The scores obtained on our validation set are on-par
with thee state-of-the-art.
