## Goal: Report on recent methods for shape regression

## Title
Population Shape Regression from Random Design Data

## Abstract
This report will analyze the paper named "Population Shape Regression from Random Design Data" and the method presented in it, authored by B. Davis, P. Thomas Fletcher, E. Bullitt, and S. Joshi. This paper aims to study anatomical shape changes, in particular of the human brain, as a function of age. Since classical regression technics use flat Euclidean spaces, they are not
able to represent the natural variability of the human anatomy. Therefore, the method developed in this paper applies regression methods to manifold-valued data (the infinite dimensional manifold of diffeomorphic transformations) that will better represent the reality.
We will try to analyze the article from a critical point of view, and assess the improvement it brought from the state of the art at the time of its publication (2010). We will also describe potential applications and introduce some examples of more recent related methods.
